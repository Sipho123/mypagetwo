                Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has been on the immediate horizon for the last 
                decade. However, we are now at a point where several factors are driving the technology
                forward and forcing the hand of manufacturers and retailers. Retailers crave sources of 
                data to optimize their business; RFID creates a whole new set of data about their 
                in-store environments, product movement, and customer behavior. As a result, companies 
                that arenâ€™t already piloting RFID are lagging the market, and those using the technology
                must continue to develop additional capabilities around it due to its potential for 
                massive cost savings and new revenue opportunities.

                <h1>RFID Technology Overview</h1>
                RFID systems are composed of tags and a reader to read them. The RFID tag has two components,
                a processor and an antenna. Tags can be active and use a battery, or passive and use power 
                from the reader. The reader can be handheld or stationary and can vary in size and strength 
                based on purpose. Tags can be on hangtags, stickers, or embedded in items. Tags can be given 
                a unique fingerprint to be tracked individually.
