                            When talking about RFD, we all acknowledge the positive impact of RFID in asset-heavy industries
                            like retail and logistics. However, there is one sector that is just beginning to realize not 
                            using RFID is a huge missed opportunity. Hospitality has been constantly engaging with innovative
                            technologies to enhance the customer experience and stand out in a competitive environment. 
                            Therefore, itâ€™s not surprising that more and more hotels are adopting RFID solutions.
                            In fact, RFID or Radio-Frequency Identification is currently the best technology available for
                            asset tracking and inventory management. Hotels deal with hundreds of assets that are constantly 
                            moving in and out of their premises and can highly benefit from a smart inventory.
